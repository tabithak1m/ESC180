# ESC180

This is a compilation of Labs done in ESC180 Introduction to Programming source. All labs are done in **Python**.  
Here, only labs with a minimum amount of complexity are included as some introductory labs were focused on learning basic python functions such as strings.

### Lab 6: Tic-tac-toe
- Using a provided ttt.py file, this lab is the code for enabling two users to play against eachother and a single user to play against the program.
  
### Lab 8: Gaussian Elimination 
- This lab implements Gaussian Elimination and test the implementation by solving a linear system.

### Lab 9: Processing Large Text Files
-  This lab computes the word count in large text files. It finds the 10 most frequently occurring words in a text file. This is tested by finding the 10 most frequently-occurring words in *Pride and Prejudice*.

### Lab 10: Recursion
